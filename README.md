# Knuckles-Recognition
This project is aimed to use the image which is concatnated by three images token by three camera on the smart glass, and determine which knuckle is closest to the smart glasses. This could enable mid-air input for smart classes such as text-entrying or function selection.

But it's unstable while the finger is too close to the camera.
